 libz80 - Z80 emulation library

Version 2.1.0

The Makefile creates libz80.so, which together with z80.h make up the binary package. 'make install' installs these files in /usr/lib and /usr/include respectively.

Emulation code itself is generated by the codegen folder. mktables.spec includes a specification of the opcodes, using regular expressions to express similar opcodes in a compact way. Binary representation of the opcodes is listed in opcodes.lst. This makes tweaking the 'processor' relatively easy, as it isn't done manually.

The tests folder includes a simple test framework and a few tests to ensure the current behavior of the processor.
