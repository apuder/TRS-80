This directory contains a test to exercise libz80 using the test suite
from FUSE.

"make" will create and run the test, comparing the expected and actual
output using diff.  A successful run will show no diff output.

The directory fuse_files contains files from FUSE.  If FUSE releases a
newer version of its test suite, copy the updated tests.in and
tests.expected files into fuse_files.

We do not check the order or timing of memory accesses, nor the timing
of i/o accesses.  The overall timing of each instruction sequence is
still checked.
