TRS-80 Emulator for Android
---------------------------

This is the first version of a TRS-80 Emulator for Android. It is
based on a popular emulator originally written for X-Windows called
xtrs [1]. This port adds a layer for Android.


Compiling from Source
---------------------

It is recommended to use Eclipse for compiling the sources. You will
need to install the Android SDK and NDK. You should also install the
accompanying ADT plugin for Eclipse (be sure to check "NDK" when
installing the ADT for Android in Eclipse).

The TRS-80 emulator depends on a project called ActionBarSherlock
[2]. Note that the way ActionBarSherlock is designed, it cannot be
integrated with the emulator. You need to import ActioBarSherlock as a
separate Eclipse project into your workspace. Next download an import
the sources of TRS-80 into Eclipse. Since your directory structure
will be different, you need to edit the location of
ActionBarSherlock. In Eclipse, right-click on TRS-80 > Preferences >
Android. In the bottom edit the path to ActioBarSherlock.

At this point you should be able to compile the sources. Note that
running the TRS-80 emulator inside the Android emulator is very
slow. It is recommended to use a real device for testing and
debugging.


Quick Overview
--------------

The original C sources of xtrs reside in the 'jni' folder. The Android
layer uses JNI (Java Native Interface) to access the C sources from
Java. Whenever I made a change to the original xtrs sources, I used
#ifdef ANDROID to annotate my changes. This should make it easy to see
what was changed.

Some of the key files:

- MainFragment.java: main entry point of the Android app
- ConfigurationsFragment.java: the "Configurations" tab
- EmulatorStatusFragment.java: the "Emulator" tab
- EmulatorActivity.java: this is the Android activity that
  runs the emulator
- XTRS: this class is the gateway to the C sources of xtrs.
  All down-calls and up-calls to the C code will go through
  this class. The native methods declared in XTRS are implemented
  in jni/native.c
- keyboard_original.xml: Android XML layout that defines the
  original Model 3 keyboard layout. Note the custom attributes
  keyboard:address and keyboard:mask. These attribtues define
  the memory-mapped bit that need to be set to "1" when the
  user pushes the key.
- Key.java: the accompanying Android custom widget that implements
  the behavior of one key of the keyboard. Note the onTouch()
  method that pokes the appropriate bits into RAM of the emulated
  TRS-80.
